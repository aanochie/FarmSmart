        <h2>Introduction </h2>
        <p>Blight disease is a common and destructive disease affecting maize crops. It can significantly reduce yield and affect the quality of the produce.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>Blight disease in maize is primarily caused by fungal pathogens. The most common pathogens include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exserohilum turcicum</strong>: Causes northern corn leaf blight.</li>
            <li><strong>Bipolaris maydis</strong>: Causes southern corn leaf blight.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Common symptoms of blight disease in maize include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lesions on leaves that are oval or cigar-shaped.</li>
            <li>Yellowing and browning of leaves.</li>
            <li>Premature death of leaves.</li>
            <li>Reduced kernel size and quality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prevention and Management</h2>
        <p>Effective management of blight disease involves a combination of cultural practices, resistant varieties, and fungicide applications. Here are some strategies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rotate crops to reduce the buildup of fungal spores in the soil.</li>
            <li>Plant resistant varieties of maize.</li>
            <li>Apply fungicides as a preventive measure, especially during favorable conditions for the disease.</li>
            <li>Ensure proper spacing between plants to improve air circulation.</li>
            <li>Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest.</li>
        </ul>
