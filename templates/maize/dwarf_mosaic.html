    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Dwarf Mosaic is a viral disease that affects maize, caused by the Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus (MDMV). It is one
        of the most common and destructive viral diseases of maize, leading to significant yield losses and stunted growth in infected plants.</p>

    <h2>Causes</h2>
    <p>MDMV is primarily spread by aphids, which transmit the virus as they feed on the sap of infected plants.
        The virus can also be transmitted through infected seed and by mechanical means.</p>

    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mosaic patterns of light and dark green or yellow on leaves.</li>
        <li>Streaking and mottling of leaf tissues.</li>
        <li>Stunted plant growth and reduced vigor.</li>
        <li>Malformed ears and poor grain development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Management</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Planting maize varieties that are resistant to MDMV.</li>
        <li><strong>Aphid Control:</strong> Managing aphid populations through the use of insecticides and biological control methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Field Hygiene:</strong> Removing and destroying infected plant residues to reduce sources of the virus.</li>
        <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotating with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Planting Date Adjustment:</strong> Planting early to avoid peak aphid activity.</li>
    </ul>
