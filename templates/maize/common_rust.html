        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Common Rust is a widespread fungal disease affecting maize (corn). It is caused by the fungus
            <em>Puccinia sorghi</em>. This disease can cause significant yield losses if not managed properly,
            particularly in susceptible maize varieties.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>Common Rust is spread by windborne spores. The fungus requires living host tissue to survive and can spread
            rapidly under favorable conditions of cool temperatures and high humidity.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Small, round to oval pustules on both leaf surfaces, initially pale green to yellow and turning reddish-brown.</li>
            <li>Pustules that release reddish-brown spores, which can rub off on hands and clothes.</li>
            <li>Severe infections that cause leaves to yellow and die prematurely, reducing photosynthetic area and plant vigor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Management</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Planting maize varieties that are resistant to Common Rust.</li>
            <li><strong>Fungicide Applications:</strong> Applying fungicides when the disease is first detected can help control its spread.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Practices:</strong> Practices such as crop rotation and maintaining good field hygiene can reduce disease pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring and Forecasting:</strong> Regularly monitoring fields for early signs of infection and using disease forecasting models to predict outbreaks.</li>
        </ul>
