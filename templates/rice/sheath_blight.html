        <h2>Introduction </h2>
        <p>Sheath Blight is the most economically impacting rice disease. It results in a serious reduction in grain yield and quality. The soilborne disease can lead up to a 50% loss in yield.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>Sheath Blight is caused by the fungus <strong>Rhizoctonia solani</strong>. The fungus can survive in soil and on infected plant debris, and can spread rapidly under favorable conditions.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Common symptoms of Sheath Blight include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Elliptical or oblong green-gray lesions on the sheath that enlarge and become grayish white with a brown margin.</li>
            <li>Infected grains may be discolored or empty.</li>
            <li>Severe infections can lead to significant yield loss.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prevention and Management</h2>
        <p>Typical prevention of Sheath Blight involves the use of foliar fungicides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Carbdenzium at 1g/lit</li>
            <li>Propicanazole at 1ml/lit</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Crops infected with Sheath Blight are treated by spraying fungicides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Benomyl</li>
            <li>Validimycin</li>
            <li>Polyoxin</li>
        </ul>
